# Operating System Course Project

Operating System course's semester-long programming project. Very challenging (can be judged from number of lines of code). I wrote a lot of C code and also spent long time in the debugger gdb.

The project was split by phases, and we were given documentations of each phase, with what files to write, what functions in each file do. The whole project is to implement along with those documentations. Of course, I interacted a lot with course instructor whenever I have doubt or stuck, and I would say this is a necessary part of such project.

Albeit a course project, this is the biggest programming project I've done so far, with help of instructors, teaching assistant and others.
